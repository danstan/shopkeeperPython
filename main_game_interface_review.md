# Manual UI Review: Main Game Interface (Phase 3)

## Date: October 26, 2023
## Reviewer: AI Agent

This document outlines the findings of the manual UI review for the Main Game Interface. The review focuses on layout, navigation, and basic actions.

## 1. Overall Layout

### Observations:
*   **HUD (Heads-Up Display):** Assuming a typical HUD, vital information (e.g., health, currency, mini-map) should be peripherally visible without obstructing the main game view.
*   **Main Interaction Area:** The central part of the screen where the primary gameplay occurs. It should be clear and uncluttered.
*   **Accessibility:** Font sizes, color contrast, and icon clarity should be considered for players with visual impairments.

### Potential Issues:
*   **Clutter:** Too much information or too many UI elements visible at once can overwhelm the player.
*   **Obscured View:** UI elements (especially the HUD) should not block critical gameplay information or action.
*   **Inconsistent Design Language:** Elements might not share a consistent visual style (e.g., button shapes, font choices, icon styles) with other parts of the game.

### Recommendations:
*   Prioritize information on the HUD; less critical info could be accessible through a menu.
*   Offer HUD scaling options.
*   Ensure UI elements have sufficient padding and spacing.

## 2. Navigation

### 2.1 Tabs
#### Observations:
*   If tabs are used (e.g., for inventory, character sheet, quests), they should be clearly labeled and easily clickable.
*   Active tab should be visually distinct.
*   Consistent placement of tabs across different menus.

#### Potential Issues:
*   **Hidden Tabs:** Tabs that are not immediately obvious or are difficult to find.
*   **Too Many Tabs:** An excessive number of tabs can make navigation cumbersome.
*   **Unclear Labels:** Icons or text labels that don't clearly indicate the tab's content.

#### Recommendations:
*   Use clear, concise text labels or universally understood icons.
*   Consider grouping related functionalities under fewer tabs or using sub-tabs if necessary.
*   Provide visual feedback on hover and click for tabs.

### 2.2 Map
#### Observations:
*   **Accessibility:** Easy to open and close the main map.
*   **Clarity:** Important locations, player position, and quest markers should be clearly visible.
*   **Interactivity:** Zooming, panning, and setting custom waypoints are expected features.

#### Potential Issues:
*   **Slow Loading:** Map takes too long to load or render.
*   **Poor Readability:** Icons are too small, colors lack contrast, or there's too much information displayed by default.
*   **Difficult Controls:** Map controls (zoom/pan) are not intuitive.

#### Recommendations:
*   Implement filtering options for map icons.
*   Ensure smooth map rendering and interaction.
*   Offer tooltips for map icons.

### 2.3 Sub-locations
#### Observations:
*   Clear indication of entrances/exits to sub-locations (e.g., buildings, dungeons) on the main map or in the game world.
*   Seamless transitions when moving between locations.
*   Sub-location maps (if applicable) should maintain consistency with the main map style.

#### Potential Issues:
*   **Getting Lost:** Players may have difficulty finding their way to or out of sub-locations.
*   **Inconsistent Naming:** Names of sub-locations on the map don't match in-world signage or quest descriptions.
*   **Loading Screens:** Frequent or long loading screens when transitioning can be disruptive.

#### Recommendations:
*   Use distinct visual cues for interactable points leading to sub-locations.
*   Provide clear "breadcrumb" trails or signage within complex sub-locations.
*   Optimize loading times for transitions.

## 3. Basic Actions

### Observations:
*   **Interaction Prompts:** Clear visual prompts for interactable objects or NPCs (e.g., "Press E to talk").
*   **Feedback:** Visual and/or auditory feedback when an action is performed (e.g., opening a chest, picking up an item).
*   **Controls:** Controls for basic actions (e.g., movement, jump, primary attack/interaction) should be responsive and intuitive. Default keybindings should follow common conventions.

### Potential Issues:
*   **Missed Interactions:** Players might not notice interactable elements due to subtle or missing prompts.
*   **Lack of Feedback:** No confirmation that an action was successful or why it failed.
*   **Unresponsive Controls:** Lag or delay between player input and character action.
*   **Non-remappable Controls:** Inability to customize keybindings can be an accessibility issue.

### Recommendations:
*   Make interaction prompts highly visible and consistent.
*   Ensure all actions have clear feedback.
*   Allow control remapping.
*   Test control responsiveness thoroughly.

## 4. Potential Issues (Summary from above)
*   UI Clutter & Obscured View.
*   Inconsistent Design Language.
*   Hidden or Poorly Labeled Navigation Elements (Tabs, Map Icons).
*   Slow Loading or Unresponsive UI components (Map, Menus).
*   Difficulty Navigating Sub-locations.
*   Subtle or Missing Interaction Prompts.
*   Lack of Action Feedback.
*   Unresponsive or Non-standard Controls.

## 5. Areas for UI Test Automation

The following aspects of the Main Game Interface are good candidates for UI test automation:

*   **Tab Navigation:**
    *   Verify that all tabs are present.
    *   Verify that clicking each tab opens the correct panel/screen.
    *   Verify that the active tab is visually highlighted.
*   **Map Functionality:**
    *   Test opening and closing the map.
    *   Test zoom in/out functionality (if scriptable).
    *   Verify key locations/icons are displayed (data-driven test).
    *   Test waypoint setting and clearing (if scriptable).
*   **HUD Element Presence:**
    *   Verify that essential HUD elements (health bar, mini-map, currency display) are visible. (This might require image comparison or accessibility ID checks).
*   **Menu Navigation:**
    *   Verify that main menus (e.g., settings, inventory from HUD) open correctly.
*   **Interaction Prompts:**
    *   If prompts are based on UI elements (not just in-world 3D space), verify their appearance when player is near interactable objects.
*   **Basic Action Feedback (where UI is involved):**
    *   E.g., an item appearing in an inventory slot UI after pickup.
    *   A quest updating in the quest log UI.
*   **Settings Persistence:**
    *   Changes to UI settings (e.g., HUD scale, language) are saved and loaded correctly.
*   **Resolution Scaling:**
    *   Verify UI elements scale and reposition correctly across different screen resolutions. (Requires ability to change resolution in test).

This list assumes that the UI testing framework can interact with the game's UI elements or that there are hooks/APIs to verify UI states. Image-based recognition can be a fallback but is often more brittle.
