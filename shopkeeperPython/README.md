# Shopkeeper Python

A Python-based implementation of a whimsical, high-fantasy, turn-based, multiplayer shopkeeper RPG.
This project aims to recreate and expand upon the concepts from the original C# Shopkeeper game, based on the provided game design document.

## Features (Planned)

*   Character Management (Stats, XP, Leveling)
*   Shopkeeping (Crafting, Selling, Specialization)
*   Economy & Itemization (Gold, Magical Items, Consumables)
*   Dynamic Event System
*   Rest Mechanics (Short/Long Rests, Exhaustion)
*   In-game Time System
*   Interactive World (Towns with unique properties)
*   Player Save States (JSON)

## Project Structure

*   `shopkeeperPython/game/`: Core game logic modules.
*   `shopkeeperPython/game/data/`: Game data files (e.g., item definitions, event templates).
*   `shopkeeperPython/tests/`: Unit tests.
*   `shopkeeperPython/docs/`: Project documentation.
*   `shopkeeperPython/main.py`: Main entry point for the game (will be created later).
